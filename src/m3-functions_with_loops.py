# TODO: 1. (4 pts)
#   
#   Now, let's try to combine a few of the things we learned in previous exercises together. We are going to improve upon some of the loops that we created in m2. Feel free to copy and paste them as you see fit.
#
#   For this _TODO_, write a function called ingredient_search() that takes two parameters:
#       - ingredient    <- str
#       - list          <- list of strs
#
#   It should loop through the given list of ingredients and check if the given ingredient is in the list. If it is, the function should return the value True. If it is not, it should return the value False.
#
#   Notice that you can't simply put an else statement with your if statement because the function will only look at the first item in the list. There are a couple of ways you can solve this, but take your best shot at it ask me if you have any questions.
#
#   Once you have done this, write 2 lines of code:
#       1. one where your function will return True
#       2. and another where your function will return False
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

# TODO: 1. (3 pts)
#   
#   For this _TODO_, write a function called triangle() that takes one parameter:
#       - size  <- int
#
#   This function should print a triange of stars (just like m2 todo #3) where the last line (the largest line) has the same number of stars as the size parameter indicates.
#
#   So, if the function is called like so:
#
#       triangle(2)
#
#   it should print
#
#
#       *
#       **
#
#   OR if it is called like this:
#
#       triangle(4)
#
#   it should print
#
#
#       *
#       **
#       ***
#       ****
#
#   Once you have done, this write a line of code that calls the function and prints a triangle of stars with the size 10.
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
