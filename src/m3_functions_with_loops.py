# DONE: 1. (4 pts)
#   
#   Now, let's try to combine a few of the things we learned in previous
#   exercises together. We are going to improve upon some of the loops that we
#   created in m2. Feel free to copy and paste them as you see fit.
#
#   For this _TODO_, write a function called ingredient_search() that takes
#   two parameters:
#       - ingredient    <- str
#       - list          <- list of strs
#
#   It should loop through the given list of ingredients and check if the given
#   ingredient is in the list. If it is, the function should return the value
#   True. If it is not, it should return the value False.
#
#   Notice that you can't simply put an else statement with your if statement
#   because the function will only look at the first item in the list. There
#   are a couple of ways you can solve this, but take your best shot at it ask
#   me if you have any questions.
#
#   Once you have done this, write 2 lines of code:
#       1. one where your function will return True
#       2. and another where your function will return False
#
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.

def ingredient_search(ingredient, list):
    for x in list:
       if x == ingredient:
        return True
    return False
print(ingredient_search(ingredient = 'egg', list = ['sugar', 'salt', 'flour']))

print(ingredient_search(ingredient = 'salt', list = ['sugar', 'salt', 'flour']))

# DONE: 1. (3 pts)
#   
#   For this _TODO_, write a function called triangle() that takes one
#   parameter:
#       - size  <- int
#
#   This function should print a triange of stars (just like m2 todo #3) where
#   the last line (the largest line) has the same number of stars as the size
#   parameter indicates.
#
#   So, if the function is called like so:
#
#       triangle(2)
#
#   it should print
#
#
#       *
#       **
#
#   OR if it is called like this:
#
#       triangle(4)
#
#   it should print
#
#
#       *
#       **
#       ***
#       ****
#
#   Once you have done, this write a line of code that calls the function and
#   prints a triangle of stars with the size 10.
#   
#   Once you have done this, then change the above _TODO_ to DONE.
